# 2DFPhysics
 2D fixed-point physics for Unity. This is currently a WIP project, any help is appriciated.    
 This project is currently based on Randy Gaul's [Custom 2D Physics Engine tutorial](https://gamedevelopment.tutsplus.com/tutorials/how-to-create-a-custom-2d-physics-engine-the-basics-and-impulse-resolution--gamedev-6331).
 
## Goals
1. Deterministic. Should get the same result on all platforms. 
2. Supports rollback. Should be able to save/restore anything having to do with the sim and play it back.
